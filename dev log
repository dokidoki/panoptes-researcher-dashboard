Looking at the specification initially, I feel I will keep everything pretty framework light and stick to the general 
MEAN stack for development as we are already using Node for the backend. 

I think D3.js will work well for the live visualisations.

In the future when we expand to phase two I would lean towards Firebase if we want some more complicated login functionality 
like Auth 2.0 or anonymous authentication. I have already developed frontend pages for email verification and password reset
which we could integrate. Firebase is also very scalable because itâ€™s built on the Google Cloud SDK which I why I use it for 
my mobile application's user login.
